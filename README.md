# Short Circuit

I often find textbooks too verbose, or their structure messy. What's more, after several weeks I've already forgotten the finer details. I therefore summarize the books I read as a reference for later. The idea is that they can be read in an afternoon, stand-alone and without prior knowledge. I greatly appreciate pull requests with improvements! I am aware that the inline code often clips outside the page; I'm still looking for a way to fix that.
